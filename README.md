# Lid-Driven-Cavity-Problem
1.Computation of Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Using Vorticity-Stream Function Formulation

2.The goal of this project is to numerically solve the steady-state lid-driven

cavity  flow using the Vorticity-Stream Function formulation.
# How to run the code.
1.The code is written in python.

2.File name is saved in .py format

3.The code is written using Vscode and the libray used in the code are numpy and matplotlib.

4. we got the results of streamline contour and velocity streamline profile and the convergence history
